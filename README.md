1. dynamic rendering
    (1) "Morning" or "Evening" title is based on the current time.
    (2) Number of routine meds are based on calculating the length of total meds on "Morning" or "Evening".
    (3) The circles are based on calculating the number of the taken meds and untaken meds on "Morning" or "Evening".
    (5) List of untaken meds is rendered as a list for users to see.
    (4) Due time, name, dosage, and dosage type are also dynamic.

2. Take button function
I implemented the take button function. After users click the take button, that med will not be shown in the take med section and the filled circle will increase by 1 and the unfilled circle will decrease by 1.

3. Made the UI more beautiful
I used the rest of my time to modify the UI.
